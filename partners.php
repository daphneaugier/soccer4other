											<p>Sometimes the most rewarding goal is helping others reach theirs. 
												That is why Soccer4Other is proud and thankful to its long lasting partners and 
												sponsors throughout the world. Today, we are proud to say that we have now organized 11 
												tournaments, having over 800 participants and impacting over 30,000 people over social media, 
												and all that thanks to our partners. </p>
												
												<p>Soccer4Other stands for creating a positive social impact 
												in it’s local, national, and international communities. This exaggerated ambition to create a positive
												 change has driven our partners to support our project with numerous different rewards that went to the
											  winners and helped with the promotion of our tournaments. Help that was given back with a spot for a
											   team composed uniquely of our partners employees in our events. Also, we helped the promotion of some
											    of our partners stores and a variety of their products too, some of which they've had direct feedback
												from our numerous participants. </p>
												
												<p>When you partner with Soccer4Other, you introduce your business and employees to a new range of opportunities 
												for growth. Whether it is through promotion on Soccer4Other accounts, opportunities for team building, or 
												positive social branding, we guarantee a harmonious and grattifying partnership. Our crave for this project to 
												function has enabled us to look further than just the financial benefit of a partnership. Breaching the limits 
												of what could be called a ‘win-win’ situation for all associated people, and observe with gladness and ambition
												 onto the next ones that will be within the reach of our help. </p>
